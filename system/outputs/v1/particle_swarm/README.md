# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

This project is a simple implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm in Python. It is designed to be easy to understand and modify, making it suitable for educational purposes and practical applications.

## Features
- Configurable number of particles and iterations
- Customizable cost function
- Verbose output showing the optimization process

## Usage
To run the PSO algorithm, execute the following command:

```bash
python examples/demo.py
```

## Project Structure
- `pso/`: Contains the core PSO implementation
  - `pso.py`: Main PSO algorithm
  - `particle.py`: Particle class
  - `cost_function.py`: Cost function class
- `examples/`: Example scripts
  - `demo.py`: Demonstration of PSO usage

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

No external libraries are required for the basic implementation.
