# Hybrid Image Creator

This project is a Python-based application designed to create hybrid images by combining two source images using various image processing techniques.

## Features
- Apply convolution and cross-correlation operations on images.
- Implement Gaussian blur, low-pass, and high-pass filters.
- Create hybrid images that change appearance based on viewing distance or scale.
