# Hybrid Image Creator

This project is a Python-based application designed to create hybrid images by applying various image processing techniques. The application uses algorithms for cross-correlation, convolution, Gaussian blur, and high-pass and low-pass filters to manipulate images.

## Features
- Image processing operations including cross-correlation, convolution, Gaussian blur, and filtering.
- Hybrid image creation by combining two images with specified filters and mix ratios.

## Technical Requirements
- Python
- NumPy
- OpenCV

## Usage
To create a hybrid image, run the following script:
```bash
python examples/example_usage.sh
```

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for image processing and hybrid image creation.
- `examples/`: Contains example images and usage scripts.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the application.
