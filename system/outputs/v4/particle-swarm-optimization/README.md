# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Implementation

This project provides a Python-based implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The implementation is designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it suitable for educational purposes and practical applications.

## Features
- Configurable PSO parameters such as the number of particles, maximum iterations, and bounds.
- Example cost functions like the sphere function.
- Verbose output showing the optimization process and results.

## Usage
To run the PSO algorithm with a demo example, execute the following command:

```bash
python examples/demo.py
```

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the PSO implementation.
- `examples/`: Contains example scripts demonstrating how to use the PSO implementation.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the PSO implementation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

No external libraries are required for the basic PSO implementation.
