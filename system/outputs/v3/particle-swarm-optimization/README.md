# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Implementation

## Introduction
This project provides a Python-based implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The implementation is designed to be minimalistic yet functional, offering a clear understanding of the PSO mechanism and its application in solving optimization problems.

## Features
- **PSO Implementation**: Configure parameters like the number of particles, maximum iterations, and problem bounds.
- **Cost Functions**: Includes example cost functions such as the sphere function, with the flexibility to define custom functions.
- **Optimization Process**: Detailed output of the optimization progress and final results.

## Usage
To use the PSO algorithm, execute the following command:
```bash
python examples/demo.py
```

## File Structure
- `examples/`: Contains example scripts demonstrating the use of the PSO implementation.
- `pso/`: Contains the core PSO implementation and related modules.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Running Examples
Navigate to the `examples/` directory and run the provided scripts to see the PSO in action.
