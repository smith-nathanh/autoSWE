# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Implementation

## Introduction
This project provides a Python-based implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The implementation is designed to be minimalistic yet functional, offering a clear understanding of the PSO mechanism and its application in solving optimization problems.

## Features
- **PSO Implementation**: Configure parameters such as the number of particles, maximum iterations, and bounds for optimization.
- **Cost Function**: Includes example cost functions like the sphere function and allows for custom cost functions.
- **Optimization Process**: Displays detailed output of the optimization progress and the best solution found.

## Usage
To use the PSO algorithm, run the following script:
```bash
python examples/demo.py
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Project Structure
- `pso/`: Contains the core PSO implementation and cost functions.
- `examples/`: Contains example scripts demonstrating how to use the PSO implementation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the example script to see the PSO in action.
